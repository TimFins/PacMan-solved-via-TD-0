# Todo

## UI
- Step forward (maybe step backward)
- Pause and continue the game
- Adjust speed, so the time pause between each action and before a new round starts
- Show learning rate, discount factor and exploration rate
- Show currently found best path (maybe via a red line through the field)
- Execute best strategy (maybe)
- Rotate pacman depending on the direction

## Algorithm
- The algorithm doesn't save the best strategy yet. It does save the best costs gained for the best strategy but not the strategy itself.

## Algorithm Testing
- Different learning rates, discount factors and exploration rates should be tested.
